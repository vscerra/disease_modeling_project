    "# Agent-Based Model: Measles Transmission in Schools \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to demonstrate an agent-based model (ABM) for measles transmission within a controlled setting (school). The aims are to demonstrate:\n",
    "- **Individual-level heterogeneity**: Each student is a separate agent with unique characteristics \n",
    "- **Spatial structure**: Students are organized by grade and classroom \n",
    "- **Contact patterns**: Realistic within-classroom and between-classroom mixing\n",
    "- **Vaccination**: Coverage patterns and clustering effects \n",
    "- **Stochastic dynamics**: Randomness in transmission and disease progression \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why an agent-based model for measles in schools? \n",
    "\n",
    "ABMs excel at capturing phenomena that compartmental models struggle with:\n",
    "- **Clustering**: Unvaccinated students often cluster in specific classrooms/communities \n",
    "- **Network effects**: Disease spreads through contact networks, not homogenous mixing \n",
    "- **Interventions**: Can test targeted strategies (e.g., classroom closures, ring vaccination)\n",
    "- **Stochasticity**: Small outbreaks can fade out randomly or explode"
